`fresh` is a full stack modern web framework for JavaScript and TypeScript
developers, designed to make it trivial to create high-quality, performant, and
personalized web applications. You can use it to create your home page, a blog,
a web application like GitHub or Twitter, or anything else you can think of.

At it's core, `fresh` is a combination routing framework and templating engine
that allows you to render pages on demand, on the server. In addition to this
just-in-time (JIT) rendering on the server, `fresh` also provides a framework
for seamlessly rendering certain components on the client for maximum
interactivity. It uses [Preact][preact] and JSX for rendering on both the server
and the client.
